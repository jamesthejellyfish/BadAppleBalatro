# BadAppleBalatro
A mod which adds a Bad Apple joker to Balatro
Requires [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded)

The joker does not alter sound, since I thought that would be annoying, but does play all of bad apple. The joker also has a hidden positive effect while held, which you can either figure out on your own or be boring and read the source code. 
To install, go to [releases](https://github.com/jamesthejellyfish/BadAppleBalatro/releases), download BadApple.zip, unzip and place all files in C:/Users/your username/AppData/Roaming/Balatro/Mods/ (you may have to make this folder)
